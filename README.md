# Advanced Time Tracker & Focus Guard 🛡️⏱️

**Stop doomscrolling. Start intentional viewing.**

Advanced Time Tracker is not just another website blocker. It is a smart digital well-being assistant that understands *how* you use the web. Instead of issuing blunt daily bans, it measures your **effective attention time** and encourages healthy consumption habits through structured sessions.

## 🌟 Why This Extension?

Most time trackers have a flaw: they count time whenever a tab is open. If you pause a YouTube video to grab lunch, your time ticks away. 

**Advanced Time Tracker is different.** 
It uses category-specific detection algorithms to track only your *active* consumption:
*   **Video Mode**: Tracks time only when the video plays. Pausing stops the timer.
*   **Reading/Social Mode**: Tracks time only when you are scrolling, typing, or interacting. If you walk away, the timer stops.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Smart Session Management
Break the endless loop of "just one more video."
*   **Sessions**: Define how long you want to focus or relax (e.g., 30 minutes of Netflix).
*   **Mandatory Rest**: Enforce a cooldown period (e.g., 5 minutes) between sessions to reset your dopamine levels and rest your eyes.

### 2. "Effective Time" Detection
*   **Video Sites** (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch): Hooks directly into the video player. Background tabs don't count unless video is actually playing.
*   **Social & Reading** (Reddit, Twitter/X, Medium): Uses activity monitoring to discard idle time.

### 3. Flexible Control
*   **Daily Limits**: Set hard caps for total usage per category.
*   **Forbidden Hours**: Completely block distracting categories during your work hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM).
*   **Visual Feedback**: A beautiful, non-intrusive dashboard and on-screen overlays keep you aware of your limits.
